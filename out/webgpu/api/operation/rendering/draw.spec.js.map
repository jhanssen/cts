If the draw is zero-sized, check that no value is written.\n\n  Params:\n  - count= {0, non-zero} either the vertexCount or indexCount\n  - instance_count= {0, non-zero}\n  - first={0, non-zero} - either the firstVertex or firstIndex\n  - first_instance={0, non-zero}\n  - mode= {draw, drawIndexed, drawIndirect, drawIndexedIndirect}\n  - base_vertex= {0, non-zero} - only for indexed draws\n\n* default_arguments - Test defaults to draw / drawIndexed.\n  - arg= {instance_count, first, first_instance, base_vertex}\n  - mode= {draw, drawIndexed}\n\n* vertex_attributes - Test fetching of vertex attributes\n  Each vertex attribute is a single value and written to one component of an output attachment.\n  4 components x 4 attachments is enough for 16 attributes. The test draws a grid of points\n  with a fixed number of primitives and instances.\n  Horizontally across the screen are primitives with increasing \"primitive id\".\n  Vertically down the screen are primitives with increasing instance id.\n\n  Params:\n  - vertex_attributes= {0, 1, max}\n  - vertex_buffer_count={0, 1, max} - where # attributes is > 0\n  - step_mode= {vertex, instanced, mixed} - where mixed only applies for vertex_attributes > 1\n\n* unaligned_vertex_count - Test that drawing with a number of vertices that's not a multiple of the vertices a given primitive list topology is not an error.
